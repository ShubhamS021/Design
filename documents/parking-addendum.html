Resident shall hold harmless and indemnify Management from and against any and all claims for damage or loss to Resident's vehicle and/or contents unless said damage was intentionally caused by Management and/or Management's agents. Resident further acknowledges that parking lots and parking areas are inherently dangerous due to the size, weight and momentum of vehicles and therefore agrees not to loiter or play in or on parking lots/areas. </p>

          <p><span class="text-uppercase"><strong>Damages:</strong></span> Resident shall be responsible for all damage caused by Resident and/or Resident's vehicle (include any substances leaking or emerging Resident's vehicle) to any parking lots, parking areas, common areas, and/or other portions of the premises. </p>
