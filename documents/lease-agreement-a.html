                  <p class="text-justify"><strong>Vinyl Plank Flooring:</strong> Certain apartment communities managed by Mark-Taylor Residential, Inc. have vinyl plank flooring in the apartments. An elegant departure from boring, traditional flooring such as carpeting or linoleum, vinyl plank flooring is nonetheless considered to be a noisier surface than these other materials. If the apartment does have vinyl plank flooring installed therein Resident is hereby advised that such flooring is generally characterized as a noisier surface than non-vinyl flooring. Despite the characteristics that cause the increased potential for noise, the building has been constructed in such a way to minimize this increased noise possibility. Such efforts to abate additional noise include the following:</p>

                  <p>Insulation: The floor insulation is R30. Normally, it is only R13 for apartments. As the "R-value" increases, so too does the insulation effectiveness for both temperature and noise.</p>

                  <p>Sound wave channeling: Resilient metal channels have been installed between the drywall and the joist/floor member to absorb and redirect sound waves.</p>

                  <p class="mb-0">While the above-mentioned noise abatement techniques were employed, Landlord cannot ensure that all noise will be absorbed by these enhancements to the building. Accordingly, Resident acknowledges that Management strongly recommends, in consideration of Resident's neighbors, that Resident utilize area rugs throughout the dwelling unit. Resident agrees to hold Management harmless for claims arising from or relating in any way to noise associated with or caused by the vinyl plank flooring. </p>

Resident hereby assumes for himself, his family, occupants, and guests any and all risks associated with the use of said pool and facilities, and agrees that Management shall not be liable for any harm sustained by Resident, his family occupants, or guests in connection with said risks. Resident further understands and agrees that the use of any facility or amenity on the community is restricted to Resident and Resident’s family, occupants, and guests, and that express consent must be given by Management prior to another person's use of such facility or amenity. Resident hereby acknowledges that the amenities provided at this community are subject to change at the sole discretion of Management. Further, Resident acknowledges that its use of the community amenities is a privilege under the terms of this Lease and subject to revocation by Management should Resident improperly use said amenities or engage in conduct that is disruptive to other resident's use and/or enjoyment of the community amenities. Further, Resident acknowledges that Management may discontinue any use of a community amenity or restrict access to said amenity in response to any public health emergency or at the order of any state, county, or local official. Notwithstanding anything appearing in this paragraph to the contrary, the Resident does not agree to the exculpation or limitation of any liability of Management arising under law or to indemnify Management for that liability or costs connected therewith.

This request for an accommodation may be made by a person with a disability or by any other person acting on behalf of such person. Management reserves the right to seek other information, including medical information, if it determines that it needs that information to determine whether a request for an accommodation is reasonable. If Management determines that a person with a disability needs the accommodation, management will grant the request unless doing so will impose an undue hardship, including an undue financial or administrative burden, or will substantially change the nature of the program that the property offers.

No structural changes may be made without the approval of Management. Any person who needs a modification of the dwelling because of a disability should contact Management. Management reserves the right to seek other information, including medical information, if it determines that it needs that information to decide whether the request for a modification is reasonable. If a modification request is reasonable, Management will grant that request subject to the requirements: (1) that the modification be done at the expense of the tenant; (2) that the modification be performed in a workmanlike manner; and (3) that if the modification will affect a subsequent tenant's use or enjoyment of the premises, that the tenant seeking the modification will agree to restore the apartment to its original condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted. </p>
