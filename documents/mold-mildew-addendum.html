          <p class="text-justify">This Mold and Mildew Addendum (the "Addendum") dated <span data-id="field-4" class="input-field mw-10p" contenteditable="true"></span> is attached to and made a part of the lease dated <span data-id="field-4" class="input-field mw-10p" contenteditable="true"></span> (the "Lease") by and between Management, as agent for owner of the Apartments ("Lessor"), and <span data-id="field-5" class="input-field mw-25p" contenteditable="true"></span> ("Resident") for unit number <span data-id="field-2" class="input-field mw-10p" contenteditable="true"></span> (the "Unit") in  <span data-id="field-1" class="input-field mw-20p" contenteditable="true"></span> Apartments (the "Apartments").</p>

          <p class="text-justify">Resident acknowledges that it is necessary for Resident to provide appropriate climate control, keep the Unit clean, and take other measures to retard and prevent mold and mildew from accumulating in the Unit. Resident agrees to clean and dust the Unit on a regular basis and to remove visible moisture accumulation on windows, walls and other surfaces as soon as reasonably possible. Resident agrees not to block or cover any of the heating, ventilation or airconditioning ducts in the Unit. Resident also agrees to immediately report to the management office: (i) any evidence of a water leak or excessive moisture in the Unit, as well as in any storage room, garage or other common area; (ii) any evidence of mold or mildew-like growth that cannot be removed by simply applying a common household cleaner and wiping the area; (iii) any failure or malfunction in the heating, ventilation or air conditioning system in the Unit; and (iv) any inoperable doors or windows. Resident further agrees that Resident shall be responsible for damage to the Unit and Resident's property as well as personal injury to Resident and Occupants resulting from Resident's failure to comply with the terms of this Addendum. </p>

          <p class="text-justify">A default under the terms of this Addendum shall be deemed a material default under the terms of the Lease, and Lessor shall be entitled to exercise all rights and remedies at law or in equity. Except as specifically stated herein, all other terms and conditions of the Lease shall remain unchanged. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Addendum and the terms of the Lease, the terms of this Addendum shall control. Any term that is capitalized but not defined in this Addendum that is capitalized and defined in the Lease shall have the same meaning for purposes of this Addendum as it has for purposes of the Lease. </p>
