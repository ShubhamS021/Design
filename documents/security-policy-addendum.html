          <p class="text-justify"><strong class="text-uppercase">Security Policy</strong>. Owner does not promise, warrant, or guarantee the safety or security of Residents or their personal property against the criminal actions of other Residents or third parties. (For purposes of this security policy, "Owner"includes owner, owner's officers and employees, and owner's property management company, onsite managers, and other owner representatives, and "Resident" refers to the Resident(s) and their families, occupants, guests and invitees of the Unit.) Owner is not acting as insurer of Resident. Resident understands and agrees that Owner is limited in its ability to protect Resident from crime, accident and natural catastrophe and that Resident is better able to evaluate individual risk and loss than Owner and to obtain insurance to protect against such events. Each Resident has the responsibility to protect himself or herself and to maintain insurance to protect his or her belongings and person. Owner strongly recommends that Residents contact an insurance agent to arrange appropriate insurance. </p>

          <p class="text-justify">It is a fact that no security system, patrol, or electronic security device can provide protection against crime at every location at every moment of the day or night. Even elaborate security systems are subject to mechanical malfunction, tampering, human error or personnel absenteeism, and can be defeated or avoided by clever criminals. Therefore, residents and occupants should not rely on such systems and should always proceed on the assumption that no security systems exist. Residents should make no other assumptions regarding security. The best safety measures are those precautions that can be performed as a matter of common sense and habit. Resident understands that crimes against persons are prevalent, especially in apartment Communities. </p>

          <p class="text-justify">If security systems, security devices, or walk-through drive-through services are utilized at this apartment community, no representation is made that they will prevent injury, theft or vandalism. Companies or individuals walking or driving the complex on behalf of Owner are unarmed independent contractors and have no greater authority under the law to restrain or arrest criminals or to prevent crime than the ordinary citizen. Resident understands and agrees that Owner has no obligation or liability for the acts or omissions, whether negligent, intentional or otherwise of any agent or employee of any such independent contractor. Resident acknowledges that Owner is under no duty to inspect, test or repair any security device unless and until Owner has received written notice from Resident, except when the Lease Term begins and in the case of a smoke detector, when a new detector is installed by Owner. Owner does not warrant that any security systems, security devices, services, or persons at this apartment community will discourage or prevent breaches of security, intrusions, thefts, or incidents of violent crime, and owner has assumed no responsibility or duty with respect to the security of Resident through the retention of any such independent contractors or the provision of any such security systems, security devices, or services. Owner reserves the right to reduce, modify or eliminate any such independent contractor's, security system, security devices, or services (other than those required by law) at any time, without notice to Residents; and such action shall not be a breach of any obligation or warranty on the part of Owner. "Neighborhood Crime Watch" signs, if any, do not imply safety or security. </p>

          <p class="text-justify">If controlled access gates or intrusion alarms are provided, Residents will be furnished written operating instructions; and it is Residents' responsibility to read them and to bring any questions to the attention of Owner. Further, it is Residents' responsibility to promptly notify Owner in writing of any known problem, defect, malfunction or failure of door locks, window latches, lighting, controlled access gates, intrusion alarms, and other security-related devices. Each Resident is responsible for reporting to Owner any crime that he or she is aware of and that occurs in Resident's apartment or in common areas near Resident's apartment. If Resident's apartment is equipped with an intrusion alarm, Resident is responsible for all fines and other charges resulting from or attributable to the alarm, including false alarm charges. Resident shall pay for and replace batteries for smoke detectors, if any, and shall pay for monthly service on the electronic alarm systems, if any, unless otherwise provided in the Lease. Resident shall not disable, disconnect. Or</p>

If Resident installs additional security devices, Owner shall be given the keys, codes or operating device immediately upon installation and any such devices installed by Resident must comply with all applicable federal state, municipal or other governmental law, code, regulation or order. </p>

          <p class="text-justify">Protecting Residents from crime is the sole responsibility of Residents and law enforcement agencies. Residents are required to call the police or 911 first if a crime occurs or is suspected. Residents are required to promptly report to Owner in writing any locks, latches, lighting, overgrown shrubbery, fences, gates, intrusion alarm, and other security-related devices that they believe are in need of repair or improvement. Any notices or requests by Resident for inspection, installation or repair of security devices or smoke detectors must be in writing. Resident recognizes that Owner's efforts are voluntary and not obligatory and are done in an effort to protect his or her safety. </p>

          <p class="text-justify"><strong class="text-uppercase">Acknowledgement and Release by Residents</strong>. Resident has read, understood, and agrees to the above security policy. Resident has received no representations or warranties, either express or implied, regarding security or security systems before or during the lease term. Owner has not stated or implied to Resident in any way that security of person or property will be provided, promised, or guaranteed. Owner has not represented that the apartment community has been or will be free from crime or that the apartment community has had little or no history of crime. Resident further acknowledges that Owner is not obligated under any circumstances to respond to any signal from an intrusion alarm system. </p>

          <p class="text-justify"><strong>RESIDENT HEREBY AGREES TO RELEASE, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD OWNER HARMLESS FROM LOSSES, CLAIMS, AND COSTS (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES) WITH RESPECT TO ANY PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE OR DEATH ARISING OUT OF CRIMINAL ACTS OF OTHER RESIDENTS AND THIRD PARTIES, OR WHICH IS IN ANY WAY RELATED TO RESIDENT'S RELIANCE ON ANY OF THE SAFETY DEVICES AND/OR ANY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR MENTIONED ABOVE OR TO ANY DEFECT, MALFUNCTION OR INADEQUACY THEREOF, FROM CLAIMS THAT INSUFFICIENT SECURITY WAS PROVIDED, AND WITH RESPECT TO THE INSTALLATION, USE, OR MALFUNCTION OF ANY SECURITY DEVICE INSTALLED OR CAUSED TO BE INSTALLED BY RESIDENT, EVEN IF SUCH OCCURRENCE(S) WERE CAUSED BY THE SOLE, CONTRIBUTORY OR PARTIAL NEGLIGENCE OF OWNER. RESIDENT THEREFOR AGREES THAT OWNER'S LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THAT EXPRESSED IN THIS LEASE AND THIS ADDENDUM.</strong> Resident acknowledges that Owner's representatives have no authority to make changes or modifications in this document unless they are in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Owner.</p>
