          <p>Addendum to Lease dated <span data-id="field-2" class="input-field mw-15p" contenteditable="true"></span> for the privilege to have a satellite dish installed in Unit # <span data-id="field-3" class="input-field mw-10p" contenteditable="true"></span></p>

          <p>Residents wishing to install satellite dishes must adhere to the following rules: </p>

          <ul class="unordered-list mb-20">
            <li><strong>Written notice must be given to the management office of your intent to install a satellite dish</strong>. This must be done prior to installation. </li>
            <li><strong>The satellite dish and all wiring must be installed within your home, or on the patio or balcony that is part of your home</strong>. It must be installed within the confines of your patio or balcony and it must not extend beyond the edge of the patio or balcony railing. You may not hang the dish out of a window. </li>
            <li><strong>Installation must not damage the home (interior/exterior) or building. You may not drill holes</strong> in railings, exterior walls or any other location. <strong>The only acceptable way to install the dish is to mount it securely on a <span class="text-uppercase">tripod</span></strong>. A removable "through the glass" transmitter must be used to transmit the signal from the dish to the interior of the home (Radio Shack carries such a transmitter called "Glass Link"). </li>
            <li class="text-uppercase"><strong><u>Cinder blocks are unsightly and are not permitted.</u></strong></li>
            <li><strong>You are liable for any injury or damage to persons or property caused by your dish; therefore, if your community does not utilize Lease Term Solutions, you must maintain liability insurance to cover any such injury or damage</strong> as long as you have the satellite dish at our community. Proof of said insurance (insurance certificate) must be provided to our office within thirty (30) day of installation. The satellite dish is installed and operated at your own risk. </li>
            <li>Not all home locations are positioned for good satellite reception; however, transferring to another home for better reception is not permitted unless your lease has expired. You must re-apply and follow all procedures. </li>
            <li><span data-id="field-1" class="input-field mw-15p" contenteditable="true"></span> does not guarantee service and is not responsible if desired service is not available in home. Resident will be responsible for all moving and transfer fees. </li>
          </ul>

          <p>I (we) have read the above Lease Addendum and rules, understand them and agree to abide by them.</p>
