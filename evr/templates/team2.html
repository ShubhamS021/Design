As Director of Planning & Development, Brad manages the planning, engineering, and horizontal construction of El Dorado’s large master-planned communities. Each is ranging in size from 200 to 1,500 acres with a combination of residential and commercial uses. Brad has a bachelor’s degree in construction management from Arizona State University and 15 years of experience in land entitlements and construction management. Before joining El Dorado, Brad worked for the City of Maricopa, where he quickly moved into a top position in the Development Services Department.  His colleagues have always noted his leadership skills and dedication to excellence. As the Capital improvement Program Manager, he was instrumental in managing over $70 million in some of the most prestigious city projects, including two fire stations, a new City Hall, a Police Headquarters, a 100-acre Regional Park/Sports Complex, and a Multi-gen and Aquatics Center. All of these past work experiences created the necessary foundation for Brad's current role working in the multi-family division called "REV." The first three REV communities are - Spur Cross(Queen Creek), Ballpark Village(Goodyear) and Porter 27(Maricopa). The Spur Cross master-planned community also includes 573 single-family lots, a large community park and swimming pool, plans for an elementary school and a church as well as a small commercial corner. Spur Cross is a $27 million infrastructure project that is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2020 and has already returned $1.5 million in contingency. Ball Park and Porter 27 will be starting the first quarter of 2021, with about $15,000,000 in site development. Brad is also involved with other EL Dorado Holdings developments, which include a 50,000 homesite project and more than 63,000 in acreage due for build-out.</p>

            <p>Mike Ingram founded El Dorado Holdings, Inc., in 1987 with Mark “Monty” Ortman (retired) with a staff of one and a single escrow property south of Phoenix. That property, John Wayne’s El Dorado Ranch, was the catalyst for growing a network of investors and land holdings strong enough to weather the real estate cycles and economic swings of the next few decades.
Ingram moved to Phoenix in 1987 with his family and personal work ethic to rise through adversity, stay focused on goals and deliver on commitments. Before moving to Arizona, he grew Tufts & Sons of Oklahoma into a company with $100 million in annual sales. When oil companies in Texas and Oklahoma went through a deep economic crisis, a chain of non-payments swept through all levels of industry, causing Ingram to sell off his successful businesses. With the sale, he paid off creditors, avoiding bankruptcy while necessitating a fresh start.</p>
            <p>Ingram’s focus on hard work and responsibility came at an early age when his father passed away. At the age of 11, Ingram put in long hours at the motel owned by his mother and picked up other jobs outside of school to help pay the mortgage. Working his way through college, Ingram graduated from New Mexico State University with a bachelor of science in four years and no debt. He earned acceptance in the national honor society, Alpha Zeta. Ingram is passionate about giving back to his community and his country. He is committed to a number of business and civic organizations and serves on the boards of the Arizona Commerce Authority, Arizona-Mexico Commission, Barrow Neurological Foundation (Emeritus), Translational Genomics Research Institute Foundation, C. M. Russell Museum, Shikar Safari Club International Foundation and the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum. He is one of the owners of the Arizona Diamondbacks, a Major League Baseball team. He is also actively involved with Pinnacle Forum, Focus on the Family, the Campus Crusade for Christ and its ministries within.</p>
